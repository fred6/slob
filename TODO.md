 - more than one alias ref'd in a log entry
 - add tags from log entry. syntax: *tag here*.
 - if theres only one possible alias and im making a bunch of logs around the same time period, i shouldnt have to confirm each time. just assume that i'm still referring to that one? there should be some way to set or infer context maybe. might be too hard to do well.
