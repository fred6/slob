research productivity system. current ideas for features:


 - track *information objects* (often pdf/djvu/epubs/etc., but can be a folder as well in the case of, say, a website or decompiled .chm) by associating a unique id with it (manualy specified so much easier)

 - store metadata (thinking keywords at the moment, not sure if anything else)

 - view the information (launches an external program to view, but logs the date/time)

 - log progress. type in your progress as you go. (if you finally managed to understand entropy, log that. if you slogged through a half-understood journal article, or even just part of it, log that if you completed a textbook exercise (or maybe 4 of them), log that)

 - emphasis should be chronological progress
